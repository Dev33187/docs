<summary><b>For certain wallets, I see both bech32 and hex while others only show hex formatted addresses, which should I use?</b></summary>

The Evmos network supports both formats: bech32 and hex. Other EVM peers and its ecosystem uses hex encoding while Cosmos-native uses bech32 formatted addresses. Keplr is unique and the EVM-compatible chains shows both formats. If you are sending tokens (via [IBC](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/relayers)), you will use bech32 formatted addresses unless the receiving chain support EVM (i.e. Ethermint-based chains). You can further details [here](./../protocol/concepts/accounts).
